**The ultimate Rust SDK and high-performance MCP server for Obsidian-flavored Markdown (.ofm) and standard .md vaults.**

TurboVault is a dual-purpose toolkit designed for both developers and users. It provides a robust, modular **Rust SDK** for building applications that consume markdown directories, and a **full-featured MCP server** that works out of the box with Claude and other AI agents.

---

## Two Ways to Use TurboVault

### 1. As a Rust SDK (For Developers)
Build your own applications, search engines, or custom MCP servers using our modular crates. TurboVault handles the heavy lifting of parsing `.md` and `.ofm` files, building knowledge graphs, and managing multi-vault environments.

- **Modular Architecture**: Use only what you need (Parser, Graph, Search, etc.).
- **High Performance**: Sub-100ms operations for most tasks.
- **Extensible**: Easily build your own specialized MCP servers on top of our core logic.
- **SOTA Standards**: Fully supports Obsidian-flavored Markdown (wikilinks, embeds, callouts).

### 2. As a Ready-to-Use MCP Server (For Users)
Transform your Obsidian vault into an intelligent knowledge system immediately. Connect TurboVault to Claude Desktop or any MCP-compatible client to gain **78 specialized tools** for your notes.

- **Zero Coding Required**: Install the binary and point it at your vault.
- **78 Specialized Tools**: Searching, optional dense/hybrid RAG, link analysis, atomic Git-backed writes, SQL frontmatter queries, health checks, and more.
- **Multi-Vault Support**: Switch between personal and work notes seamlessly at runtime.

## Why TurboVault?

Unlike basic note readers, TurboVault understands your vault's **knowledge structure**:

- **Full-text search** across all notes with BM25 ranking
- **Optional dense and hybrid RAG** using hierarchical, context-preserving chunks and an OpenAI-compatible embedding endpoint
- **Link graph analysis** to discover relationships, hubs, orphans, and cycles
- **Vault intelligence** with health scoring and automated recommendations
- **Validated operation batches** for fewer round trips and fail-fast execution
- **Multi-vault support** with instant context switching
- **Runtime vault addition** — no vault required at startup, add them as needed

### Powered by TurboMCP

TurboVault is built on **[TurboMCP](https://github.com/epistates/turbomcp)**, a Rust framework for building production-grade MCP servers. TurboMCP provides:

- **Type-safe tool definitions** — Macro-driven MCP tool implementation
- **Standardized request/response handling** — Consistent envelope format
- **Transport abstraction** — HTTP, WebSocket, TCP, Unix sockets (configurable features)
- **Middleware support** — Logging, metrics, error handling
- **Zero-copy streaming** — Efficient large payload handling

This means TurboVault gets battle-tested reliability and extensibility out of the box. Want to add custom tools? TurboMCP's ergonomic macros make it straightforward.

## Quick Start

### Installation

**From crates.io**

```bash
# Minimal install (7.0 MB, STDIO only - perfect for Claude Desktop)
cargo install turbovault

# With HTTP server (~8.2 MB)
cargo install turbovault --features http

# With all cross-platform transports (~8.8 MB)
# Includes: STDIO, HTTP, WebSocket, TCP (Unix sockets only on Unix/macOS/Linux)
cargo install turbovault --features full

# With SQL frontmatter queries (adds GlueSQL-powered query_frontmatter_sql tool)
cargo install turbovault --features sql

# Binary installed to: ~/.cargo/bin/turbovault
```

**From source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samuelueluel/turbovault.git
cd turbovault
make release
# Binary: ./target/release/turbovault
```

### Option 1: Static Vault (Recommended for Single Vault)

```bash
turbovault --vault /path/to/your/vault --profile production
```

Then add to `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "turbovault": {
      "command": "/path/to/turbovault",
      "args": ["--vault", "/path/to/your/vault", "--profile", "production"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Windows stdio with Claude Code

Windows releases include `turbovault-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe.zip`. Extract the executable and add a local stdio server to Claude Code through `.mcp.json` or the equivalent user-scoped configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "turbovault": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "C:\\Tools\\TurboVault\\turbovault-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe",
      "args": [
        "--vault",
        "C:\\Users\\me\\Documents\\ObsidianVault",
        "--profile",
        "production"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Run `claude mcp list` or open `/mcp` to verify the connection. The Windows binary uses the same JSON-lines stdio protocol as Linux and macOS.

### Option 2: Runtime Vault Addition (Recommended for Multiple Vaults)

Start the server without a vault:

```bash
turbovault --profile production
```

Then add vaults dynamically:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "turbovault": {
      "command": "/path/to/turbovault",
      "args": ["--profile", "production"]
    }
  }
}
```

Once connected to Claude:

```
You: "Add my vault at ~/Documents/Notes"
Claude: [Calls add_vault("personal", "~/Documents/Notes")]

You: "Search for machine learning notes"
Claude: [Uses search() across the indexed vault]

You: "What are my most important notes?"
Claude: [Uses get_hub_notes() to find key concepts]
```

### Optional Dense and Hybrid RAG

TurboVault keeps BM25 sparse search available without any model service. Dense retrieval and cross-encoder reranking are optional, independently configurable additions. Their endpoints may run locally or in the cloud; hosted inference is never forced.

#### Local endpoints

The built-in defaults target local services on ports 8082 and 8083. Set the variables explicitly when the endpoint or model differs:

```bash
export TURBOVAULT_EMBEDDING_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:8082/v1/embeddings
export TURBOVAULT_EMBEDDING_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B-GGUF
export TURBOVAULT_RERANKER_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:8083/v1/rerank
export TURBOVAULT_RERANKER_MODEL=BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3
```

#### Optional OpenRouter endpoints

OpenRouter exposes compatible embedding and rerank APIs. Selecting these values sends note chunks, queries, and reranking candidates to OpenRouter and its routed providers:

```bash
export TURBOVAULT_EMBEDDING_ENDPOINT=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/embeddings
export TURBOVAULT_EMBEDDING_MODEL=openai/text-embedding-3-small
export TURBOVAULT_EMBEDDING_API_KEY="$OPENROUTER_API_KEY"

# Optional second stage. Dense + BM25 retrieval still works when this is false.
export TURBOVAULT_RERANKER_ENABLED=true
export TURBOVAULT_RERANKER_ENDPOINT=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/rerank
export TURBOVAULT_RERANKER_MODEL=cohere/rerank-v3.5
```

The reranker reuses `TURBOVAULT_EMBEDDING_API_KEY` by default. Set `TURBOVAULT_RERANKER_API_KEY` only when reranking uses a different credential or provider. Set `TURBOVAULT_RERANKER_ENABLED=false` to keep hybrid BM25 plus dense retrieval without sending candidates to a reranker.

#### Hierarchical chunking

Markdown is split by structure rather than by a fixed character window alone. Each top-level content section remains a retrieval boundary, but its smaller subsections stay in the same chunk when the full subtree fits. Oversized sections split recursively at child headings, then at complete Markdown blocks, sentences, and finally characters only as a last resort. Every embedding input includes the note title, path, and active heading breadcrumb. Headings inside fenced code blocks do not create false sections, and overlap reuses complete blocks rather than arbitrary character tails.

#### Optional PDF and DOCX indexing

Set `TURBOVAULT_DOCUMENT_INDEXING_ENABLED=true` to include text-layer PDFs and `.docx` files in the dense index. PDF page numbers and Word heading styles become chunk locators. Extraction runs locally without a model, and extracted text remains derived state outside the vault. `TURBOVAULT_DOCUMENT_MAX_BYTES` sets the per-file limit in bytes and defaults to 50 MiB.

Scanned PDFs without a text layer are skipped because they require OCR; legacy `.doc` files are not supported. Attachment indexing affects dense retrieval only: lexical `search()` continues to search Markdown notes. When the embedding endpoint is hosted, extracted attachment text is sent to that provider just like Markdown chunks. Adding, editing, or removing an eligible attachment is detected from its file fingerprint and triggers an incremental refresh on the next semantic search.

The vector index stays outside the vault. Its default root is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\turbovault\embeddings` on Windows and `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/turbovault/embeddings` or `~/.cache/turbovault/embeddings` elsewhere. Override it with `TURBOVAULT_EMBEDDING_INDEX_DIR`.

After connecting an MCP client, call `embedding_index_status()` and then run `reindex_embeddings()` once. The chunker and index schema changed in this release, so an existing dense index must be rebuilt once. Use `semantic_search()` for conceptual retrieval; it fuses BM25 and dense candidates and applies reranking when enabled. Later refreshes reuse vectors for unchanged source hashes, and a failed endpoint degrades the affected channel rather than disabling lexical `search()`.

### Atomic Git-Backed Writes

For vaults already managed by Git, enable the transactional backend in the
TurboVault YAML config:

```yaml
vaults:
  - name: personal
    path: ~/Documents/Notes
    is_default: true
    write_backend: git
    git:
      include_ignored: false
      require_commit_message: false
```

Start with `turbovault --config ~/.turbovault/config.yaml`. Every mutation is
then a Git commit. Multi-operation batches build one isolated tree and advance
the branch with compare-and-swap, so a stale path aborts the entire batch and
concurrent TurboVault processes cannot interleave commit/materialization. The
backend also refuses to overwrite dirty or untracked touched paths and refuses
to reset an index containing staged changes.

## What Can Claude Do?

### Search & Discovery
```
You: "Find all notes about async Rust and show how they connect"
Claude: search() -> recommend_related() -> get_related_notes() -> explain relationships
```

### Vault Intelligence
```
You: "What's the health of my vault? Any issues I should fix?"
Claude: quick_health_check() -> full_health_analysis() -> get_broken_links() -> generate fixes
```

### Knowledge Graph Navigation
```
You: "What are my most important notes? Which ones are isolated?"
Claude: get_hub_notes() -> get_isolated_clusters() -> suggest connections
```

### Structured Note Creation
```
You: "Create a project note for the TurboVault launch with status tracking"
Claude: list_templates() -> create_from_template() -> write auto-formatted note
```

### Batch Content Operations
```
You: "Move my 'MLOps' note to 'AI/Operations' and identify links to update"
Claude: get_backlinks() -> move_note() -> edit_note() for each affected reference
```

### Link Suggestions
```
You: "Based on my vault, what notes should I link this to?"
Claude: suggest_links() -> get_link_strength() -> recommend cross-references
```

## Real-World Workflows

### Initialize Without a Vault

```python
# Server starts with NO vault required
response = client.call("get_vault_context")
# Returns: "No vault registered. Call add_vault() to get started."

response = client.call("add_vault", {
    "name": "personal",
    "path": "~/Documents/Obsidian"
})
# Auto-initializes: scans files, builds link graph, indexes for search
```

### Multi-Vault Workflow

```python
# Add multiple vaults
client.call("add_vault", {"name": "work", "path": "/work/notes"})
client.call("add_vault", {"name": "personal", "path": "~/notes"})

# Switch context instantly
client.call("set_active_vault", {"name": "work"})
search_results = client.call("search", {"query": "Q4 goals"})

client.call("set_active_vault", {"name": "personal"})
recommendations = client.call("recommend_related", {"path": "AI/ML.md"})
```

### Vault Maintenance & Repair

```python
# Quick diagnostic
health = client.call("quick_health_check")
if health["data"]["score"] < 60:
    # Deep analysis if needed
    full_analysis = client.call("full_health_analysis")

# Find and fix issues
broken = client.call("get_broken_links")
# Process broken links...

# Atomic bulk repair
client.call("batch_execute", {
    "operations": [
        {"type": "DeleteNote", "path": "old/deprecated.md"},
        {"type": "MoveNote", "from": "old/notes.md", "to": "new/notes.md"},
        # ... more operations
    ]
})

# Verify improvement
client.call("explain_vault")  # Holistic view
```

### Content Discovery

```python
# Find what matters
hubs = client.call("get_hub_notes")  # Top concepts
orphans = client.call("get_dead_end_notes")  # Incomplete topics

# Deep search
results = client.call("search", {"query": "machine learning"})

# Explore relationships
related = client.call("get_related_notes", {
    "path": "AI/ML.md",
    "max_hops": 3
})

# Get suggestions
suggestions = client.call("suggest_links", {"path": "AI/ML.md"})
```

## Performance Profile

| Operation | Time | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| `read_note` | <10ms | Instant with caching |
| `get_backlinks`, `get_forward_links` | <50ms | Graph lookup |
| `write_note` | <50ms | Includes graph update |
| `search` (10k notes) | <100ms | Tantivy BM25 |
| `quick_health_check` | <100ms | Heuristic score |
| `full_health_analysis` | 1–5s | Exhaustive, use sparingly |
| `explain_vault` | 1–5s | Aggregates 5+ analyses |
| Vault initialization | 100ms–5s | Depends on vault size |

**Key insight**: Fast operations (<100ms) for common tasks, slower operations (1–5s) for exhaustive analysis. Claude uses smart fallbacks.

## Configuration Profiles

| Profile | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| `development` | Local dev with verbose logging |
| `production` | Production with security auditing and optimized logging |
| `readonly` | Read-only access for safe exploration |
| `high-performance` | Large vaults (10k+ notes) with aggressive caching |

## Tool Visibility

TurboVault can reduce `tools/list` context by applying TurboMCP visibility rules from `~/.turbovault/config.yaml` or `--config`:

```yaml
tool_visibility:
  hidden:
    - full_health_analysis
    - explain_vault
  disabled:
    - delete_note
```

Use `hidden` for advanced tools that should stay callable by exact name, `disabled` for tools that should fail closed, and `allowed` when you want an explicit allowlist. Equivalent env/CLI overrides are available via `TURBOVAULT_HIDDEN_TOOLS`, `TURBOVAULT_DISABLED_TOOLS`, `TURBOVAULT_ALLOWED_TOOLS`, and `--hidden-tools`, `--disabled-tools`, `--allowed-tools`.

## SDK and Server Implementation

TurboVault is designed for two primary audiences: developers building on top of the **Rust SDK** and users looking for a **standalone MCP server**.

### As a Standalone MCP Server

The quickest way to get started is using the pre-built binary. It's fully self-contained and optimized for performance:
- **Link-time optimization** (LTO) for maximum speed
- **Configurable transports** (STDIO, HTTP, WebSocket, TCP)
- **Zero external dependencies** (just point it at your vault)

```bash
# Build the optimized binary
cargo build --release --features full

# Run it
./target/release/turbovault --vault /path/to/vault --profile production
```

### As a Rust SDK (Library)

The core of TurboVault is a collection of modular crates. Use them to build your own search engines, knowledge management tools, or even **your own specialized MCP servers**.

```rust
// Use in your own Rust projects
use turbovault_core::MultiVaultManager;
use turbovault_vault::VaultManager;
use turbovault_tools::SearchEngine;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // 1. Initialize the MultiVault manager
    let manager = MultiVaultManager::new();
    
    // 2. Add and initialize a vault (scans files, builds graph)
    manager.add_vault("notes", "/home/user/notes").await?;
    
    // 3. Perform high-level operations
    let vault = manager.get_vault("notes")?;
    let results = vault.search("machine learning")?;
    
    // 4. Use these components to build your own custom MCP server
    // or integrate into existing Rust applications.
    Ok(())
}
```

Each crate is published to crates.io, so you can depend on individual components or the full stack.

## Architecture

Built as a modular Rust workspace:

```
turbovault-core        — Core types, MultiVaultManager, configuration
turbovault-parser      — OFM (Obsidian Flavored Markdown) parsing
turbovault-graph       — Link graph analysis with petgraph
turbovault-vault       — Vault operations, file I/O, atomic writes
turbovault-batch       — Validated sequential batch operations
turbovault-export      — JSON/CSV/Markdown export
turbovault-sql         — SQL frontmatter queries (GlueSQL, feature-gated)
turbovault-tools       — 74 MCP tool implementations
turbovault-plugin-api  — Curated plugin facade, provider contract, event hooks
turbovault (binary)    — CLI and MCP server entry point
```

All crates are published to [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/turbovault-core) for public use.

## Obsidian Flavored Markdown (OFM) Support

TurboVault fully understands Obsidian's syntax:

- **Wikilinks**: `[[note]]`, `[[note|alias]]`, `[[note#section]]`, `[[note#^block]]`
- **Embeds**: `![[image.png]]`, `![[note]]`, `![[note#section]]`
- **Tags**: `#tag`, `#parent/child/tag`
- **Tasks**: `- [ ] Task`, `- [x] Done`
- **Callouts**: `> [!type] Title`
- **Frontmatter**: YAML metadata with automatic parsing
- **Headings**: Hierarchical structure extraction

## Security

- **Path traversal protection** — No access outside vault boundaries
- **Type-safe deserialization** — Rust's type system prevents injection
- **Atomic writes** — Temp file → atomic rename (never corrupts on failure)
- **Hash-based conflict detection** — `edit_note` detects concurrent modifications
- **File size limits** — Default 10MB per file (configurable), enforced on reads and writes
- **Protected directories** — `.obsidian/`, `.git/`, `node_modules/`, and TurboVault's own `.turbovault/` state are unreachable through the note APIs on both write backends
- **No shell execution** — Zero command injection risk
- **Security auditing** — Detailed logs in production mode

## System Requirements

- **Rust**: 1.90.0 or later
- **OS**: Linux, macOS, Windows
- **Memory**: 100MB base + ~80MB per 10k notes
- **Disk**: Negligible (index is in-memory)

## Examples

### Example 1: Search-Driven Organization

```
You: "What topics do I have the most notes on?"
Claude:
  1. get_hub_notes() -> [AI, Project Management, Rust, Python]
  2. For each hub:
     - get_related_notes() -> related topics
     - get_backlinks() -> importance/connectivity
  3. Report: "Your core topics are AI (23 notes) and Rust (18 notes)"
```

### Example 2: Vault Health Improvement

```
You: "My vault feels disorganized. Help me improve it."
Claude:
  1. quick_health_check() -> Health: 42/100
  2. full_health_analysis() -> Issues: 12 broken links, 8 orphaned notes
  3. get_broken_links() -> List of specific broken links
  4. suggest_links() -> AI-powered link recommendations
  5. Apply fixes individually, or use batch_execute() after reviewing its fail-fast semantics
  6. explain_vault() -> New health: 78/100
```

### Example 3: Template-Based Content Creation

```
You: "Create project notes for Q4 initiatives"
Claude:
  1. list_templates() -> "project", "task", "meeting"
  2. create_from_template("project", {
       "title": "Q4 Planning",
       "status": "In Progress",
       "deadline": "2024-12-31"
     })
  3. Creates structured note with auto-formatting
  4. Returns path for follow-up edits
```

## Benchmarks

M1 MacBook Pro, 10k notes, production build:

- **File read**: <10ms
- **File write**: <20ms
- **Simple search**: <50ms
- **Graph analysis**: <200ms
- **Vault initialization**: ~500ms
- **Memory usage**: ~80MB
- **External-change reconciliation**: ~19ms per pass, at most once per 500ms

## Keeping up with edits you did not make

A vault is a shared directory. Obsidian is usually open on it, and an editor, a
`git pull`, or a sync client may touch it while TurboVault is running. Search,
the link graph, similarity, and vault stats are all derived from the notes, so
none of that would reach them on its own.

Before serving any of those, TurboVault compares a `(size, mtime)` scan against
what it last recorded and applies whatever moved. Comparing state cannot miss a
change the way filesystem notifications can, which matters most on exactly the
setups where notifications are weakest: network shares, and iCloud, Dropbox, or
Syncthing vaults, none of which report a peer's edits at all.

The pass is debounced, so a burst of tool calls costs one scan and an idle
server costs nothing. Worst-case staleness is the interval, at least 500ms and
scaled up only on a vault large enough to need it. Set
`reconcile_external_changes: false` to turn it off for a vault nothing else
writes.

## Roadmap
